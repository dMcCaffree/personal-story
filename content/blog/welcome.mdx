I've decided to start writing more about what I'm building and learning. This blog will be a space for me to share thoughts on software engineering, product development, and the journey of building things from scratch.

## Why now?

After building [file.rocks](https://file.rocks), [Swell](https://swell.so), and [Marvel](https://marvel.so), I've realized that some of the most valuable lessons come from the process itself - not just the final product. I want to document that process.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Engineering decisions** - Why I chose certain tech stacks and architectures
- **Product thinking** - How I approach building products people actually want
- **Lessons learned** - Mistakes made and insights gained
- **Building in public** - Transparent updates on what I'm working on

## Stay tuned

I'm excited to share more. If you're interested in following along, check back here regularly or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dMcCaffree).

Let's build something great.
