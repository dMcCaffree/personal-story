<div id="intro">

Software is about to get weird. Not in a bad way, necessarily, but in a way that's going to fundamentally change how we think about building and using it.

I've been thinking a lot about where we're headed, and I wanted to capture some predictions as a time capsule. Something to look back on when I'm old and gray (well, grayer) and either laugh at how wrong I was or feel smug about being right.

Let's walk through five different time horizons and explore what software might look like at each stage. Fair warning: the further out we go, the more I'm just making educated guesses. But that's half the fun, right?

<div id="three-months">

## 3 months from now

Agents are the hot new thing everyone's talking about. Within the next three months, we're going to see an explosion of experimentation as developers realize that chatbots aren't the only interface pattern for AI.

But here's the thing: very little will actually change in the grand scheme. We're in that awkward phase where everyone knows something big is happening, but nobody quite knows what to do with it yet. It's like when the iPhone first came out and every app was just trying to figure out what touch interfaces even meant.

You'll see a lot of experimental agent frameworks popping up. Some will let AI tools call other AI tools. Some will try to orchestrate multiple agents working together. Most of it will be over-engineered and under-useful, but that's how we learn. We need to fumble around in the dark before we find the light switch.

The companies that succeed in this window won't be the ones with the most impressive tech demos. They'll be the ones that solve actual problems people have, using agents as a means to an end rather than an end in themselves.

</div>

<div id="twelve-months">

## 12 months from now

By the end of 2026, we're going to see design thinking start to fundamentally shift. The forward-thinking startup leaders and product teams will have adopted new tools that dramatically accelerate prototyping.

Think about how long it takes to go from idea to working prototype right now. You need to sketch wireframes, debate design decisions, build components, wire up backend logic, deploy infrastructure. Even with modern tools, it's weeks of work minimum.

Within a year, the best teams will be doing this in days or hours. Not because AI is writing all the code (though it'll help), but because the entire process of turning ideas into testable software will become more fluid. You'll describe what you want, iterate on it visually in real-time, and deploy variations to test with users before your coffee gets cold.

We're also going to see a huge trend in agent orchestration tooling. Companies will start building productized services that use custom software to automate entire processes that currently require human teams. The competitive advantage will be keeping teams lean while maintaining high profit margins.

This is where things get interesting economically. If a five-person startup can ship as fast as a fifty-person company did two years ago, what happens to all those middle-layer roles? I don't have a great answer, but it's coming whether we're ready or not.

<div id="three-years">

## 3 years from now

By 2029, generative UI will be everywhere, but nobody will call it that anymore. It'll just be how software works.

You know how right now, everyone using Gmail sees basically the same interface? In three years, your email app will look different from mine because it's been tailored to how each of us actually works. Not through manual customization settings buried in a menu somewhere, but because AI agents have been watching how we use it and building interfaces optimized for our patterns.

This shift will be driven by agents whose entire job is to delight users. They'll be constantly A/B testing interfaces on a per-user basis, learning what works, and adapting. It won't feel magical anymore because it'll be so commonplace.

The bigger shift, though, will be in our personal devices. We'll have much better AI support built into our phones, laptops, and operating systems. The feeling of magic we have with AI tools in 2026 will fade because we'll be using them dozens of times a day for mundane tasks.

Your average person, the proverbial layman who doesn't care about technology, will be relying on AI in their daily life without thinking about it. They'll ask their phone to reorganize their schedule when something comes up, and it'll just happen. They'll dictate rough ideas for an email while walking the dog, and it'll be cleaned up and sent by the time they get home.

The barrier between thought and action will get thinner. That's simultaneously exciting and a little unsettling.

</div>

<div id="ten-years">

## 10 years from now

By 2036, we'll be firmly out of the AI bubble. It won't be exciting anymore in startup circles because it'll just be infrastructure. Like how nobody gets excited about having a database anymore, you just have one because of course you do.

Enterprise software will have stopped using AI as a buzzword. It'll only show up in products where it genuinely makes things better. All the forced AI features that companies added because they felt like they had to? Those will have been quietly deprecated and forgotten.

But some genuinely transformative things will have happened by then.

The big one, I think, will be personalized media. We'll have choose-your-own-adventure style TV shows and movies that are unique to each viewing. Not in a gimmicky way, but as a legitimate new form of entertainment. The algorithms will understand story structure, pacing, and character development well enough to generate compelling narratives on the fly.

Video games will be absolutely incredible. When we look back on even the best open-world games from 2026, they'll feel impossibly constrained. The idea that NPCs had pre-written dialogue trees will seem quaint. Every conversation, every quest, every story beat will be generated in response to what you've done and who your character has become.

I'm genuinely excited about this future. The interactive entertainment possibilities are staggering.

<div id="fifty-years">

## 50 years from now

Look, fifty years is a really long time. I'll be nearly 85 years old, assuming I make it that far. I'll have probably given up trying to understand whatever teenagers are doing with technology, much like how my grandparents never quite figured out smartphones.

But I can make some guesses.

Personal AI devices, which are kind of a meme right now (remember the Humane AI Pin?), will be as normal as tapping your phone to pay for the subway. We'll have AI in our contact lenses, hearing aids, glasses, rings, watches, phones, and probably a dozen other form factors I can't even imagine yet.

All of it will be personalized. All of it will be running agents in the background, trying to make your life easier in small ways. You'll have agentic companions that know your preferences, your schedule, your relationships, your goals, and they'll be constantly working to smooth out the friction in your daily life.

From our 2026 perspective, this will look like some combination of dystopia and utopia. If we manage to democratize these technologies, they could genuinely help humanity advance at an incredible rate. Imagine if everyone had access to world-class education, personalized to their learning style and pace. Imagine if administrative overhead for healthcare, government services, and logistics all became near-zero.

That's the utopian vision.

The dystopian part is that we'll have some serious growing pains getting there. Questions about privacy, autonomy, and who controls these AI systems will need to be answered. Not with blog posts and think pieces, but with actual policy and technical standards. Some of those answers will be messy and imperfect and we'll probably get a few of them wrong before we get them right.

But I'm fundamentally optimistic. I think we'll figure it out, even if the path there is bumpy.

So there you have it. My predictions, my time capsule, my stake in the ground about what the future of software might look like.

Will I be right? Probably not about everything. The fun part is seeing which things I completely missed and which trends I spotted early.

Those are my thoughts in general, a bit of a time capsule, if you will. And you will. Or, well, you did. Read it, that is.

See you in 50 years, babes.
