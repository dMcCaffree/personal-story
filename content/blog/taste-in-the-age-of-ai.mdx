We're living through a remarkable moment in software development. You can literally vibe with an AI, describe what you want, and get a working website. No CS degree required. No years of grinding through Stack Overflow. Just conversation and iteration.

**And that's amazing.**

But here's what I've noticed after reviewing hundreds of AI-generated products: they all look the same. Not just similar. I mean *literally the same*. Like they were stamped from the same template, because in many ways, they were.

The barrier to building has collapsed. The barrier to building something *good* hasn't budged an inch. If anything, it's gotten higher, because now the differentiator isn't technical skill. It's taste.

## The Four Pillars of Digital Taste

After building dozens of sites (both with and without AI), I've found that great design comes down to four details that most people (and definitely most AIs) get wrong:

1. **Fonts** (more than just Inter)
2. **Colors** (please, not another purple)
3. **Inspiration** (mood boards > AI autopilot)
4. **Copywriting** (humans write differently than LLMs)

Let's break each one down.

---

## 1. Fonts

Here's a fun game: open 10 random AI-generated landing pages. I'll bet you at least 8 of them use <FontPreview fontName="Inter" fontFamily="var(--font-inter)">**Inter**</FontPreview>. Maybe one uses <FontPreview fontName="Roboto" fontFamily="var(--font-roboto)">**Roboto**</FontPreview>. If you're really lucky, you might find a rogue <FontPreview fontName="Poppins" fontFamily="var(--font-poppins)">**Poppins**</FontPreview>.

Don't get me wrong, <FontPreview fontName="Inter" fontFamily="var(--font-inter)">Inter</FontPreview> is a *fantastic* font. It's clean, readable, and works everywhere. But when everyone uses it, nobody stands out.

<FontComparison />

### The Problem with Default Fonts

AI models are trained on the web as it exists. And the web as it exists is dominated by a handful of fonts that became popular precisely because they're safe, accessible, and free. This creates a feedback loop:

- Designers use safe fonts
- AI learns from those designs
- AI suggests safe fonts
- New sites look like old sites

### Breaking the Cycle

You don't need to be a typography expert. You just need to make *one conscious choice*:

**Pick a font pairing that expresses your brand's personality.**

- Building something technical? Try <FontPreview fontName="JetBrains Mono" fontFamily="var(--font-jetbrains-mono)">**JetBrains Mono**</FontPreview> or <FontPreview fontName="IBM Plex Mono" fontFamily="var(--font-ibm-plex-mono)">**IBM Plex Mono**</FontPreview>
- Going for elegance? <FontPreview fontName="Playfair Display" fontFamily="var(--font-playfair-display)">**Playfair Display**</FontPreview> with <FontPreview fontName="Source Sans" fontFamily="var(--font-source-sans)">**Source Sans**</FontPreview>
- Want that startup energy? <FontPreview fontName="Space Grotesk" fontFamily="var(--font-space-grotesk)">**Space Grotesk**</FontPreview> with <FontPreview fontName="Inter" fontFamily="var(--font-inter)">**Inter**</FontPreview>
- Making something playful? <FontPreview fontName="Outfit" fontFamily="var(--font-outfit)">**Outfit**</FontPreview> or <FontPreview fontName="DM Sans" fontFamily="var(--font-dm-sans)">**DM Sans**</FontPreview>

The key is *intentionality*. When you choose a font because it *means something* to your product, people feel it.

## 2. Colors

Let's talk about the elephant in the room. Or should I say, the purple in the room.

If you've used **shadcn/ui** or any Tailwind-based UI library, you've seen it: that default purple (<ColorSwatch hex="#8B5CF6">`#8B5CF6`</ColorSwatch>). It's everywhere. Every button, every badge, every call-to-action looks *exactly the same*.

<ColorPaletteComparison />

### Why Everyone Defaults to Purple

Purple became the "startup color" around 2018-2020. It was fresh, it wasn't corporate blue, and it signaled innovation. Companies like Twitch, Discord, and countless SaaS products adopted it.

Then component libraries made it the default. And AI, being trained on these libraries, keeps suggesting it.

The result? A sea of indistinguishable purple websites.

### Building a Real Palette

Here's my process for choosing colors:

1. **Find inspiration first** (more on this next)
2. **Extract 2-3 colors** from something you love
3. **Use a tool like Coolors or Realtime Colors** to build a full palette
4. **Test in both light and dark mode**
5. **Replace your framework's defaults**

Your brand color should come from *your vision*, not from Tailwind's default config.

## 3. Inspiration

Here's the biggest mistake I see: people ask AI to design something with zero visual reference. They just describe it in words and hope for the best.

**Design is a visual medium.** You need visual inspiration.

### The Mood Board Mindset

Before I build anything, I spend 30-60 minutes collecting inspiration:

- **Real-world products** I love using

I don't copy these. I *synthesize* them. I look for:

- Color combinations that feel right
- Layout patterns that guide attention well
- Animation styles that enhance (not distract)
- Typography pairings that work

Then I can give AI *specific references*: "Make this hero section, but with the color energy of Stripe's new brand and the typography weight of Linear."

### What Happens Without Inspiration

When you skip this step, you get generic-by-default:

- Centered hero sections with generic taglines
- Three feature cards in a row
- A testimonial carousel
- A purple CTA button

It's not *bad*. It's just... expected. Forgettable.

## 4. Copywriting

I can spot AI-written copy from a mile away:

### The LLM Writing Pattern

AI tends to write in a very specific style:

- **Over-explains everything** ("Discover the power of...")
- **Uses superlatives constantly** ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "seamless")
- **Follows predictable structures** (problem → solution → benefits)
- **Lacks personality** (no jokes, no edge, no voice)

<CopywritingComparison />

### Writing Like a Human

Good copy is:

- **Specific** (not "increase productivity" but "save 2 hours a day")
- **Conversational** (use contractions, ask questions)
- **Opinionated** (have a point of view)
- **Surprising** (break expectations occasionally)

Compare these:

**AI-generated:**
> "Revolutionize your workflow with our cutting-edge platform that seamlessly integrates with your existing tools to boost productivity and drive results."

**Human-written:**
> "Your workflow is probably broken. We built this because we were tired of switching between 15 apps just to ship one feature."

See the difference? The second one has *voice*. It makes a claim. It assumes you share the frustration. It's memorable.

## How To Get Tasty (Tasteful?)

So here's my framework for building something that doesn't look like everything else:

1. **Collect inspiration** (30-60 min on mood boarding)
2. **Choose fonts intentionally** (pick for personality, not popularity)
3. **Build a custom color palette** (steal from your inspiration)
4. **Write your copy first** (before you show it to AI)
5. **Then let AI implement** (with your aesthetic locked in)

AI is incredible at *implementing* your vision. It's terrible at *having* one.

---

## Why This Matters Now

- **The bottom 80%** will all look the same (Inter, purple, generic copy)
- **The top 20%** will stand out precisely because they *made tasteful choices*

The irony is that having taste has never been more valuable *and* never been more accessible. You don't need to code anymore. You don't need design school. You just need three things:

1. **Look with your eyes**
2. **Sweat the details**
3. **Make intentional, tasteful choices**

---

## Your Turn

Next time you're building something (whether you're writing code manually or vibing with an AI), ask yourself:

- Does this font choice mean something?
- Would someone recognize this color palette as mine?
- Did I collect visual inspiration before starting?
- Would a human actually talk like this?

If you can't answer yes to all four, you're blending in.

And in 2026, blending in is the real risk.
