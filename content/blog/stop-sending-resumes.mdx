You applied to 87 jobs this month. You heard back from 3. Two were rejections. One ghosted you after the first email. You're refreshing LinkedIn like it's a slot machine, hoping the next pull is different.

It won't be. The mass-apply approach is broken.

I know because I've been on both sides. I've been the person sending out 100 resumes hoping something sticks. And I've been the hiring manager watching 400 identical applications pour in for a single role. Most of them get skimmed for about 6 seconds before the next one loads. That's not an exaggeration. That's the actual average.

## The Numbers Game Isn't a Game You Can Win

Here's what happens when you hit "Easy Apply" on LinkedIn 20 times a day. Your resume lands in a pile with hundreds of others. An ATS scans it for keywords. If you're lucky, a recruiter spends a few seconds on it before moving on. If you're really lucky, you get a generic rejection email three weeks later.

The response rate for cold applications in 2026 is somewhere around 2-4%. For software engineering roles at competitive companies, it's even lower. You're not job searching. You're buying lottery tickets.

And the worst part? Every application looks the same. Everyone has the same bullet points. "Built scalable microservices." "Led cross-functional teams." "Improved performance by X%." Recruiters are reading the same resume 400 times a day with different names on it.

## One Company Per Day

Here's what I do instead. And I'm going to be honest with you, it sounds like more work. It is more work per company. But the results aren't even comparable.

**Every single day, I pick one company.** Not a job posting. A company. It doesn't matter if they have an open position. It doesn't matter if they're even hiring. I pick a company that I genuinely love the idea of working at. A company that fits my interests, my skills, and my energy.

Then I spend my day on that one company. That's it. One company. Done right.

<ApproachComparison />

## The Five-Step Playbook

Let me walk you through exactly what a day looks like.

### 1. Choose One Company You Love

This is the most important part and most people skip it entirely. Don't just pick from a list of "companies hiring software engineers." Pick a company that excites you. A company whose product you actually use, whose mission you believe in, whose team you'd want to grab coffee with.

If you're a frontend engineer who loves design tools, maybe it's Figma. If you're into developer experience, maybe it's Vercel or Railway. If you care about healthcare, find the startup that's solving the problem you wish someone would solve.

The point is that when you genuinely care about the company, everything that follows becomes authentic instead of forced.

### 2. Deep Dive Into Their World

Now you research. And I don't mean skimming their "About" page for 30 seconds. I mean actually understanding the company.

Look at their website. Read their blog posts. Check out their team page. Look at what they've shipped recently. Read their values and figure out if they actually live by them (check Glassdoor, check Twitter, check their engineering blog). Look at their positioning in the market. Who are their competitors? What makes them different?

By the end of this step, you should be able to talk about this company like you already work there. You should understand their challenges, their strengths, and where they're headed.

### 3. Figure Out Where You Fit

This is where it gets personal. If this company were your family, if it were the only place you could ever work, where would you belong? What would you do there?

Maybe they have a fantastic product but their marketing site is outdated. Maybe their onboarding flow has obvious friction points. Maybe their API docs could use a serious upgrade. Maybe they're expanding into a market where your specific experience is exactly what they need.

You're not looking for a job posting to match your resume. You're looking at the company and figuring out where your skills create the most value. That's a fundamentally different approach.

### 4. Create Something That Proves It

This is where you separate yourself from every other applicant on the planet. Instead of telling the company what you can do, you *show them*.

Depending on what your role would be at that company, you're going to create something specific. If you're a frontend engineer, maybe you rebuild a page on their site and make it better. If you're a marketer, maybe you write ad copy for their next campaign. If you're a product person, maybe you make a short video reviewing their product with specific, actionable feedback.

The key is that it has to be *for them*. Not a generic portfolio piece. Not a "look what I can do" demo. Something that says "I understand your business, I see where I fit, and here's proof that I can do it."

Remember, this is the only company you're focused on today. You have the time to make something good. Make it count.

### 5. Strategic Outreach

Now that you have something worth sharing, share it with everyone. And I mean everyone.

Find people at the company on LinkedIn. Find them on Twitter. If you can find email addresses, use them. If you can't find emails, guess them. If Josh works at the company, send it to josh@company.com. Most companies follow a predictable email format (first@company.com, first.last@company.com, firstlast@company.com). Try them all. The worst that happens is a bounce.

You're not sending a cover letter. You're sending them something you made for them. That's a fundamentally different conversation.

## The Drip Campaign That Changes Everything

Here's where most people would stop. They'd do all that work, send one round of outreach, and then move on. Don't do that.

Every time you add a new company to your pipeline, you're also setting up follow-ups. Think of it like a drip campaign for sales, because that's exactly what this is. You're selling yourself, and you're doing it well.

**Day 1:** Initial outreach. Send your work to everyone you can find at the company.

**Day 4 (three days later):** First follow-up. Quick, friendly. "Hey, I sent this over a few days ago and wanted to make sure you saw it. I put together [brief description] because [reason it matters to them]."

**Day 8 (one week after initial):** Second follow-up. Different angle. Maybe reference something new the company shipped. Show that you're paying attention.

As you add one company per day, these follow-ups start compounding. By the end of week one, you have 5 companies in your pipeline. By week two, you have 10. And each one has three touchpoints scheduled.

## Why This Actually Works

I want to be real about something. When I follow this process, combined with creating content online and leveraging my network, I often get offers without doing any traditional interviews. No coding challenges. No whiteboard sessions. No "design a system that handles a million requests per second."

People vouch for me and my ability based on the work I've shown them. They've already seen what I can do. The interview is just a formality at that point, if it happens at all.

That might sound unrealistic. But think about it from the hiring manager's perspective. Someone just showed up with a custom piece of work built specifically for your company. They clearly understand your product, your market, and your challenges. They've demonstrated the exact skills you need. Why would you put them through a generic interview process?

Compare that to the person who sent a resume through an ATS with the same bullet points as 400 other candidates. It's not even close.

## The Hard Truth

If you follow this process and still don't hear back, there are really only two explanations.

**One:** You're not marketable for the role you're going after. That's fixable. Build more projects, learn new skills, adjust your target.

**Two:** The market is genuinely terrible. That happens. But even in a down market, the person doing targeted, high-quality outreach will always outperform the person mass-applying.

The problem right now isn't that there aren't jobs. It's that sending resumes into the void has almost zero chance of landing you a real conversation at a company you actually want to work at.

## Stop Buying Lottery Tickets

Here's the thing. Applying to 100 jobs and hoping for the best is comfortable. It feels productive. You can tell yourself you're "putting yourself out there." But the expected value is terrible.

One company per day, done right, is uncomfortable. It takes real effort. You have to think, research, create, and put yourself out there in a way that's personal and specific. But the expected value is wildly higher.

Twenty targeted applications in a month with a 40% response rate will always beat 100 generic ones at 2%. The math doesn't lie.

So pick a company tomorrow. Just one. Fall in love with what they're building. Figure out where you fit. Build something that proves it. And show it to every person there you can find.

Then do it again the next day.
